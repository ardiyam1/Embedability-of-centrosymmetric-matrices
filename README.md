# Embedability-of-centrosymmetric-matrices
This repository contains some computations for the paper "Embeddability and rate-identifiability ofcentrosymmetric matrices" by Muhammad Ardiyansyah. Dimitra Kosta, and Jordi Roca-Lacostena. These computations are implemented in Mathematica and Polymake and Python programming languageas well.

The file SSMembedding.py is the older version python code for the embeddabiity of centrosymmetric matrices of size 4. Moreover, the files Centrosymmetric_Volume.py and Centrosymmetric_DDVolume.py are the older version python codes for the embeddabiity of centrosymmetric matrices of size 6. The files Output 4x4.txt and Output 6x6.txt provide the output of these older python computations.

The file (Updated) Mathematica: Volume4x4 Markov SSM.nb contains the updated version of the Mathematica correcting typos in the older code Mathematica: Volume4x4 Markov SSM.nb. The file SSMembedding(Alg5.8).py provides the pyton code the algorithm 5.8 in Casanellas et al. Finally, the files SSMembedding(Positive_eigenvalues-Algorithm5.8).py and SSMembedding(Positive_eigenvalues-Thm2)..py provide the implemented criteria based on algorithm 5.8 and Theorem 2 of our paper, respectively.
