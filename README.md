# Embedability-of-centrosymmetric-matrices
This repository contains some computations for the paper "Embeddability and rate-identifiability ofcentrosymmetric matrices" by Muhammad Ardiyansyah. Dimitra Kosta, and Jordi Roca-Lacostena. These computations are implemented in Mathematica and Polymake.

The file SSMembedding.py is the python code for the embeddabiity of centrosymmetric matrices of size 4. Moreover, the files Centrosymmetric_Volume.py and Centrosymmetric_DDVolume.py are the python codes for the embeddabiity of centrosymmetric matrices of size 6. The files Output 4x4.txt and Output 6x6.txt provide the output of the python computations.
